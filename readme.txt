[Related King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/related-king-pro/) gives you an easy ability to display related posts on your site. The related posts are based on the tags on each post.
When output, [Related King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/related-king-pro/) will get posts in order of the amount of tags that match the post your calling the plugin on.

With [Related King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/related-king-pro/) you have a few options including how many related posts will display at one time, whether not not to display images, 
the width and height of the image output and whether you require a placeholder (mainly for development using the placehold.it images).

[Related King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/related-king-pro/) uses a smart imaging system where it will search for your images within the post in a couple of areas.
It will first look for the feature image of the post. If this is not set, it will search the content for the first image inserted. If that then doesn't exist, it will either, depending
on the placeholder setting, it will display no image code or a placeholder image in its place.

[Related King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/related-king-pro/) outputs an image (if one exists) and the title with links to the article on both surrounded by a number of containers with enough classes on them to 
enable you to style them to your requirements. 
There is bare CSS that comes with [Related King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/related-king-pro/) which allows you to style the related articles any way you need to.

You can use [Related King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/related-king-pro/) in two ways, either shortcode or widget. Both have the same settings available.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After activating this plugin, my site has broken! Why? =

Nine times out of ten it will be due to your own scripts being added above the standard area where all the plugins are included. If you move your javascript files below the function, "wp_head()" in the "header.php" file of your theme, it should fix your problem.
